        Battambang (Khmer: បាត់ដំបង, Bătdâmbâng [ɓatɗɑmɓɑːŋ]; "Lost Stick") is a
        province of Cambodia in the far northwest of the country. Bordering
        provinces are Banteay Meanchey to the north, Pursat to the east and
        south, Siem Reap to the northeast, and Pailin to the west. The northern
        and southern extremes of the province's western boundaries form part of
        the international border with Thailand. In addition, Tonlé Sap forms
        part of the northeastern boundary between Siem Reap and Pursat. Its
        capital and largest city is Battambang.

        It is the fifth most populous province in Cambodia.[1] In land area,
        Battambang is the fifth largest province of Cambodia. Battambang is one
        of the provinces included in the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve.[2] The
        province's fertile rice fields have led to a mostly agricultural economy
        giving rise to the moniker "the rice bowl of Cambodia".

        Battambang literally means 'loss of staff or stick' in Khmer, referring
        to the local legend of Preah Bat Dambang Kranhoung. No stone
        inscriptions from the pre-Angkorian and Angkorian eras have yet been
        discovered containing mention of any contemporary villages or districts
        called "Battambang".
