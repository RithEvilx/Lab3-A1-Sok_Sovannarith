        Phnom Penh (/pəˌnɒm ˈpɛn, ˌpnɒm -/;[6][7][8] Khmer: ភ្នំពេញ, Phnum Pénh
        [pʰnomˈpɨɲ]) is the capital and most populous city of Cambodia. It has
        been the national capital since the French protectorate of Cambodia and
        has grown to become the nation's primate city and its economic,
        industrial, and cultural centre.

        Phnom Penh succeeded Angkor Thom as the capital of the Khmer nation but
        was abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by King
        Norodom. Institutions of higher learning included the Royal University
        of Phnom Penh (established in 1960 as Royal Khmer University), with
        schools of engineering, fine arts, technology, and agricultural
        sciences, the latter at Chamkar Daung, a suburb.

        The city was nicknamed the "Pearl of Asia" for its early 20th century
        colonial French architecture, which included Art Deco works.[10] Phnom
        Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and
        domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is
        noted for its historical architecture and attractions. It became the
        national capital in 1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so
        until 1497.[11] It regained its capital status during the French
        colonial era in 1865. There are a number of surviving colonial-era
        buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.
