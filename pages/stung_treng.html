        Stung Treng[2] (Khmer: ស្ទឹងត្រែង, UNGEGN: Stœ̆ng Trêng [stɨŋ traeŋ];
        Thai: เชียงแตง, Chiang Taeng, pronounced [t͡ɕīa̯ŋ tɛ̄ːŋ] ; Lao: ຊຽງແຕງ,
        Xiang Taeng, pronounced [sía̯ŋ tɛ̀ːŋ]; lit. "River of Reeds") is a
        province of Cambodia in the northeast. It borders the provinces of
        Ratanakiri to the east, Mondulkiri and Kratié to the south and Kampong
        Thom and Preah Vihear to the west. Its northern boundary is Cambodia's
        international border with Laos. The Mekong River bisects the province.
        The province is mostly covered by forest, but logging and fishing put
        high pressure on the forest and fishery reserves.[3]

        Originally, Stung Treng was named "Tonle Ropov (Khmer: ទន្លេរពៅ), which
        is now an area in Stung Treng called "Tonle Ropov Area" (Khmer:
        តំបន់ទន្លេរពៅ).

        The name “Satung Teng (Khmer: សាទឹងទែង)" was founded by a monk named
        "Seang Peng (Khmer: សៀង ប៉េង) from Vientiane. The words “Satung Teng"
        have changed to "Xiang Taeng (Khmer: សៀងទែង). In Lao, the word "Xiang"
        means "goddess" who has resigned, while the word “Taeng” means "built".

        Due to advancement in the Khmer language, it was later called "Stung
        Treng (Khmer: ស្ទឹងត្រែង)" which means a river of reeds.[4]
