        Oddar Meanchey (Khmer: ឧត្តរមានជ័យ, UNGEGN: Ŏttâr Méanchoăy, ALA-LC:
        Uttar Mānjăy [ʔoɗɑː miəncɨj]; lit. 'Victorious North') is a province of
        Cambodia in the remote northwest. It borders the provinces of Banteay
        Meanchey to the west, Siem Reap to the south and Preah Vihear to the
        east. Its long northern boundary demarcates part of Cambodia's
        international border with Thailand. The capital is Samraong.

        The province was created on 27 April 1999, after being carved from the
        northern half of Siem Reap province and part of Banteay Meanchey. It
        existed as a province already from 1962 to 1970 under Norodom Sihanouk's
        Sangkum regime, but later became an administrative no-man's-land, with
        its status alternating between a province and a district under
        successive regimes.[2]

        Oddar Meanchey means 'victorious North'.[citation needed] The province's
        name is of Sanskrit origin through Pali and is derived from the words
        uttarā (उत्तर), meaning 'north', and jaya (जय) which means
        'victory'.[citation needed] Khmer Mean (មាន) means 'to have'.
