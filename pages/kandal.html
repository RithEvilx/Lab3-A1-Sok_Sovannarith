        of Cambodia located in the southeast portion of the country. It

        provinces of Kampong Speu and Takéo to the west, Kampong Chhnang and
        Kampong Cham to the north, Prey Veng to the east, and shares an

        approximately eight kilometres (5.0 mi) south of central Phnom Penh.
