        Mondulkiri (Khmer: មណ្ឌលគិរី, UNGEGN: Môndôlkĭri, ALA-LC: Maṇḍalagirī
        [mɔndɔl.kiriː]; lit. 'Center of Mountains') is a province (khaet) of
        Cambodia. Bordering the provinces of Kratié to the west, Stung Treng to
        the northwest, Ratanakiri to the north, and the country of Vietnam to
        the east and south. It is the most sparsely populated province in the
        country despite being the largest in land area. The province was
        established in 1961 from the eastern part of Kratié province. The
        capital is the town of Senmonorom.

        In 1960 Mondulkiri was created out of Kratié province by order of King
        Norodom Sihanouk. Saen Monorom was set up as the capital in 1962. During
        the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, Mondulkiri was home to three bases of
        the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam which resulted in
        numerous incursions and bombings by US forces. About 1970 the area fell
        under Khmer Rouge domination. Subsequently, much of the populace was
        forcibly removed to Koh Nhek (Kaoh Nheaek) district to provide labor for
        rice farming. Schools, hospitals and even entire villages were
        destroyed. As many as half of the people in the province died during the
        forced relocation in the 1970s.
