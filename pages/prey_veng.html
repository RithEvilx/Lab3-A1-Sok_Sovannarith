        Prey Veng (Khmer: ព្រៃវែង [prɨj.ʋɛːŋ]; "Long Forest") is a province
        (khaet) of Cambodia. The capital is Prey Veng. With a population of 1.1
        million people, it is the third most populous province.

      <p>
        This densely populated agricultural region is located on the east bank
        of the Mekong. The name literally means "long forest" in khmer, but the
        last great forests have gradually disappeared there over 30-year to
        provide for agricultural land.

        In early Christian era, the province was a major center of the kingdom
        of Funan, between economic and political capitals of the country what
        were Oc Eo (now in the Vietnamese province of An Giang) and Angkor Borei
        (in the Cambodian province of Takéo province).

        In the 15th century, the Khmer emperors, under threat from the Siamese
        (former name of people of current Thailand) decided to resettle back to
        the east, to Oudong, Lovek then Phnom Penh. Prey Veng did not favor them
        as it was too close to another danger, namely the Annam. Nevertheless,
        they formed an army at Ba Phnom in 1473 to defend against an invasion of
        Siam.
