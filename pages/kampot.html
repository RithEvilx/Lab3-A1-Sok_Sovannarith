        Kampot (Khmer: កំពត [kɑmpɔːt]) is a province in southwestern Cambodia.

        In the 19th century, during the French Indochina period, Kampot became a
        regional administrative center with the status of a state border
        district as a result of the delimitation of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The
        Circonscription Résidentielle de Kampot contained the arrondissements of
        Kampot, Kompong-Som, Trang and Kong-Pisey.[5][6]

        In 1889, French colonial census reports a multi-ethnic community: Kampot
        town consisted of "Cambodian Kampot" on the Prek-Kampot River and
        "Chinese Kampot" on the right riverbank of the west branch of the
        Prek-Thom River. Nearby was also a Vietnamese village, called Tien-Thanh
        and another Vietnamese village on Traeuy Koh Island. A Malay also
        existed on Traeuy Koh Island. Additional villages of mixed ethnicity are
        listed.[7]
