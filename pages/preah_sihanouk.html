        Preah Sihanouk (Khmer: ព្រះសីហនុ, UNGEGN: Preăh Seihânŭ, ALA-LC: Braḥ
        Sīhanu [preah səjhanuʔ]), also Sihanoukville, is a province (khaet) in
        southwest Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand. The provincial capital, also
        called Sihanoukville, is a deep water port city and a steadily growing
        and diversifying urban center on an elevated peninsula.[5]

        First established as Kampong Som (Khmer: កំពង់សោម), the province was
        later renamed in honor of former King Norodom Sihanouk, who orchestrated
        the establishment of Sihanoukville city and the Sihanoukville
        municipality as this took place alongside the construction of the
        Sihanoukville Port, which commenced in June 1955. The only deep water
        port of Cambodia, it includes an oil terminal and a transport logistics
        facility.[6][7]

        The official name in Khmer is: Khaet ('province') Preah ('holy')
        Sihanouk (name of the former king), which translates to, 'province of
        the holy Sihanouk' or 'honorable Sihanouk province'. It honors the
        former king Norodom Sihanouk (reigned 1941–1955 and 1993–2004) who was
        and still is revered as the "father of the modern nation".[17] Sihanouk
        himself suggested the official Western variant Sihanoukville. The name
        "Sihanouk" is derived from Sanskrit through two Pali words, sīha
        ('lion'), and hanu ('jaws').
