        Kampong Thom is Cambodia's second largest province by area. There are a
        number of significant Angkorian sites in the area, including Prasat
        Sambor Prei Kuk and Prasat Andet temples. As one of the nine provinces
        bordering Tonle Sap Lake, Kampong Thom is part of the Tonlé Sap
        Biosphere Reserve.[2]
