        Ratanakiri (Khmer: រតនគិរី, UNGEGN: Rôtânôkĭri, ALA-LC: Ratanagirī
        [rɔətanakiriː]; lit. 'Gem Mountains') is a province of northeast
        Cambodia. It borders the provinces of Mondulkiri to the south and Stung
        Treng to the west and the countries of Laos (Attapeu) and Vietnam (Gia
        Lai and Kon Tum) to the north and east, respectively. The province
        extends from the mountains of the Annamite Range in the north, across a
        hilly plateau between the Tonlé San and Tonlé Srepok rivers, to tropical
        deciduous forests in the south. In recent years, logging and mining have
        scarred Ratanakiri's environment, long known for its beauty.

        For over a millennium, Ratanakiri has been occupied by the highland
        Khmer Loeu people, who are a minority elsewhere in Cambodia. During the
        region's early history, its Khmer Loeu inhabitants were exploited as
        slaves by neighboring empires. The Khmer Rouge built its headquarters in
        the province in the 1960s, and bombing during the Vietnam War devastated
        the region. Today, rapid development in the province is altering
        traditional ways of life.

      <p>
        Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 184,000 residents make up just
        over 1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in
        villages of 20 to 60 families and engage in subsistence shifting
        agriculture. Ratanakiri is among the least developed provinces of
        Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak.
        Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life
        expectancy is 39 years, and women's is 43 years. Education levels are
        also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.
