        Kep (Khmer: ខេត្តកែប, UNGEGN: Kêb, ALA-LC: Kaep [kaep]) is the smallest
        province (khaet) of Cambodia[2] covering 336 km2 (130 sq mi), with a
        population of 41,798.[1] It is one of the newest Cambodian provinces,
        together with Pailin, Sihanoukville and Tboung Khmum, created by Royal
        Decree on 22 December 2008, which separated Kep Municipality & Damnak
        Chang'aeur District from the Kampot province, as well as adjusting
        several provincial borders.[3][4] It is both the smallest and least
        populous province of Cambodia. The provincial capital is Kep and the
        province contains the Kep National Park.

        The territory of Kep is entirely surrounded by Kampot province except
        for the 16 km of sea coast on the southern side fronting the Gulf of
        Thailand and the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc. The western limit is 20
        km from the town of Kampot. The eastern limit is some 20 km from the
        Vietnamese border.

        Under French rule Kep belonged to the Circonscription Résidentielle de
        Kampot,[9] developing into Cambodia's most prestigious beach town.
        Established as such in 1908 and named Kep-sur-Mer it was a thriving
        resort town for the French and Cambodian elite until the early
        1970s.[10]
