        Banteay Meanchey (Khmer: បន្ទាយមានជ័យ [ɓɑntiəj miəncɨj]) is a province
        of Cambodia located in the far northwest. It borders the provinces of
        Oddar Meanchey to the north, Siem Reap to the east, Battambang to the
        south, and shares an international border with Thailand to the west. Its
        capital and largest city is Serei Saophoan.

        Banteay Meanchey is the 13th largest province in Cambodia. With a
        population of 861,883, it ranks as the ninth most populous in the
        nation. The city of Poipet in the western part of the province is an
        international border crossing into Thailand. Banteay Meanchey is one of
        the nine provinces that are part of the Tonlé Sap Biosphere Reserve.[2]

        Banteay Meanchey means "Victorious Fortress" in Khmer. The word chey
        (ជ័យ) is derived from the Sanskrit word jaya (जय) meaning "victory" with
        mean (មាន) means ''to have'', so the combination of both literally means
        ''to have victory'' and banteay (បន្ទាយ) is a Khmer word meaning
        "fortress" or "castle".[3]
