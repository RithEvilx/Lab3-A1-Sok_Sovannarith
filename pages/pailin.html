        Pailin (Khmer: ប៉ៃលិន, Pailĭn [ˈpajlɨn]) is a province in western
        Cambodia at the northern edge of the Cardamom Mountains near the border
        of Thailand.[2] This province is surrounded by Battambang province, and
        was officially carved out of Battambang to become a separate
        administrative division after the surrender of the Ieng Sary faction of
        the Khmer Rouge in 1996.[3] Pailin is known to much of the world for
        having long been a stronghold of the Khmer Rouge,[4] remaining under
        their control long after they were defeated in 1979 and serving from
        1994 to 1998 as the capital of the Provisional Government of National
        Union and National Salvation of Cambodia. Within Cambodia, Pailin is
        known for its natural resources, namely precious gems and timber.

        In the early 1970s, Pailin was a prosperous town stemming from the
        extensive gem deposits in the surrounding countryside. Because of its
        resources, it was one of the first cities invaded by the Khmer Rouge
        when they began their major offensive against the Khmer Republic
        government. The city offered no resistance and the Khmer Rouge soldiers
        were greeted as liberators as they marched into town. At this point, the
        deposed prince Norodom Sihanouk had allied himself with the Khmer Rouge
        and most residents believed that they were fighting to restore him to
        power. Those believed to have connections to the government were killed.
        The Khmer Rouge used proceeds from mining in the Pailin area to fund
        their offensive and later their government once they gained national
        power. When the invading People's Army of Vietnam ousted them from
        power, they retreated to Pailin, where many former Khmer Rouge leaders
        remain today. It was the capital of the Provisional Government of
        National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia.
