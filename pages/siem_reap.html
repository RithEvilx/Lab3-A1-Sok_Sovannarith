        Siem Reap province is the tenth largest province in Cambodia. Having
        reached a population of one million in 2019, it ranks as the nation's
        fourth most populous province.[2] A large portion of Siem Reap
        province's southern border is demarcated by the Tonle Sap and as such,
        it is one of the nine provinces that making up the Tonle Sap Biosphere
        Reserve. In modern times the province is best known as the site of
        Angkor and the Angkor Wat temple ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It
        is also the home of Banteay Srei, Roluos (temples), the UNESCO tentative

        The name Siem Reap literally means 'Siam defeated', a reminder of the
        centuries-old conflict between the Siamese and the Khmer. In Siam, the
        province and its capital were called Siemmarat (Thai: เสียมราฐ),
        literally meaning 'Siam's territory'.[4]
