        Koh Kong (Khmer: កោះកុង, Kaôh Kŏng [kɑh koŋ]) is a province (khaet) of
        Cambodia. Its capital is Khemarak Phoumin (Koh Kong).[3]
      </p>
      <p>
        The most southwestern province of Cambodia, Koh Kong has a long
        undeveloped coastline and a mountainous, forested, and largely
        inaccessible interior which includes part of the Cardamom Mountains,
        Cambodia's largest national park (Botum Sakor National Park), and a
        section of Kirirom National Park.

        From 1795 to 1904 the area was under Siamese administration with the
        local name of "Koh Kong". During the reign of King Mongkut the name
        Patchan Khiri Khet was given to the city as a counterpart to Prachuap
        Khiri Khan, a city on the same latitude which also had its name changed
        during the same year. In 1904, the region and the city of Trat was ceded
        to French Indochina in exchange of French troop evacuation from
        Chanthaburi. In 1907 Trat was returned to Siam in exchange for the
        Siamese province of Inner Cambodia while Koh Kong remained part of
        French Cambodia.

        After Cambodia's liberation from the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Koh Kong
        province was quite under-populated. It is estimated that the average annual growth rate in Koh Kong
        is 16%, which has put pressure on the mangrove resources in the
        province. Koh Kong's towns have developed rapidly partially in response
        to market pressures from Thailand and because of immigration from other
        parts of Cambodia.[4]
