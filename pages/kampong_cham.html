        Kampong Cham (Khmer: កំពង់ចាម, UNGEGN: Kâmpóng Cham [kɑmpɔŋ caːm];
        lit. 'Cham Port') is a province of Cambodia located on the central
        lowlands of the Mekong River. It borders the provinces of Kampong
        Chhnang to the west, Kampong Thom and Kratié to the north, Tboung Khmum
        to the east, and Prey Veng and Kandal to the south. Kampong Cham was
        officially divided into two provinces on 31 December 2013 in what was
        seen by many as a political move by the ruling party.[2][3] All land
        west of the Mekong remained Kampong Cham while land east of the river
        became Tbong Khmum province. Prior to this division, Kampong Cham
        extended eastward to the international border with Vietnam, was the
        eleventh largest province in Cambodia, and with a population of
        1,680,694, was the most populous province in Cambodia. Its capital and
        largest city is Kampong Cham.

        Kampong Cham means "Port of the Chams" in Khmer. Kampong means port or
        harbor. Cham refers to the ethnic Cham people living in the province.
        The word kampong in Cham is shared in other Austronesian languages, but
        in Malay and Indonesian it means village and is generally spelled
        kampung. A symbol the province is known for is two snakes wrapped around
        each other, which is located at the capital city bridge, Kampong Cham.
